<#

In general, functions added to the Private folder will be available for module use, but not published to users.

The FluxorRS module has no private functions currently. Feel free to add your own functions to this directory.

We depend on the Get-FluxCredential function which is part of the Fluxor module.
If desired, such function can be moved to the private or public folders of FluxorRS, though not required.
