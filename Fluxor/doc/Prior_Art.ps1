  Matt Hodge                      -  Syntax inspired by Graphite-PowerShell-Functions
  D'Haese Willem                  -  Syntax inspired by naf_perfmon_to_influxdb.ps1
  Jerad Jacob                     -  Syntax for Invoke-RestMethod
  PaulieShore, kamao, and hyorch  - Solution for Issue #6 "Invoke-RestMethod : The operation has timed out" (added some new parameters and default behavior to handle this general PowerShell problem with Invoke-RestMethod).
